# Welcome to 'Introduction to Data Visualization in R'!

This course is specifically designed for beginners and people with no coding
experience. It covers setting up R/RStudio, the basics of data
visualisation and compound figure design as well as data transformation using
the R `tidyverse`. 

The following repository contains course notes and analyses scripts combined in
Rmd, R notebooks and pdf files. In addition, the course presentations are
provided as html files.

The course contains exercises for each section, both in the course notes and
the presentation. Solutions to the exercises can be found in the presentation.
The data to run the examples is stored in the 'data' directory. Figures created
throughout the course are stored in the 'results' directory.

The course covers:

1. Installation of R, Rstudio and the required R libraries (part 1; pre-course
preparation, no presentation);
1. Data visualisation with `ggplot2` (part 2);
1. Compound figures with `cowplot` (part 3);
1. Data transformation with `dplyr` (part 4).

To follow the course, start with part 1 (R-course-part1-installation.pdf), which
explains how to set up R/RStudio, then get started with the second part by
opening the .Rmd file (R-course-part2-ggplot.Rmd) in RStudio and the .html file
(R-course-part2-ggplot-presentation.html) in a browser.

This course was initally run as part of the *Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory career development series*.
It was designed and taught by Hannah V. Meyer, faculty at Cold Spring Harbor 
Laboratory. References for data and adapted figures as indicated.
