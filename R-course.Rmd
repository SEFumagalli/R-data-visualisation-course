# Setting up

## Starting a Rproject for your analysis
First, we will set up a project, where you will keep all files
associated with that project - inlcuding your analysis reports, input data,
results and figures. 

* In R studio click *File > New Project*.
* Choose *Existing directory*, then click on *Browse* to find the folder that
you created with the course material
* Click *Create Project*

In your files plane in R studio you can now see all the files you downloaded 
for this workshop. We will be able to easily read them into R and save results
there. 

There are other ways of specifying the folders from which you read and where you
write results and save plots to, but I would highly recommend this strategy.
It keeps everything neat and you have all the important parts of your analysis
in one place.

R studio can be customised and I leave this to everyone to figure out what
works best. However, I would recommend changing one default setting, which will
ensure that when you start working in your project, you start of with a clean
slate and none of previously computed data sticks around and confuses your
analysis.

For this setting go to *RStudio > Preferences* (on Mac) and ** (windows/unix).
In *General* untick *restore .RData into workspace at startup*. 

We are all set now to go ahead with your first analyis and data visualisation
in R!

## Setting up an analysis report
The document you are looking at right now is a R Notebook. R Notebooks allow
us to interleaf text describing our analysis with the R code that
actually contains the analyses commands. 

The text follows some simple markdown rules (for instance bold header sections
etc, which we will not go into detail here). Important for us at this stage is
that whenever we want to include analysis code into the document, we have
to create an R code *chunk*. To include a new *chunk* click the _Insert_ buttom
at the top of your editor window and select _R_.

All code *chunks* have some default settings, concering their layout, execution
etc, which can be heavily customised. For our beginners tutorial, we do not
have to worry about all of these. I mention this here, as the following and
first chunk of our document contains some basic options that I want to have
applied to all chunks in the rest of the document. Specifically, it tells R
studio that when I prepare this document for sharing with you as a pdf, that
I want both the actual code and the results displayed in the document. It also
specifies the width and alignment of the figures in the final document.


```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      comment = "#>",
                      collapse = TRUE,
                      fig.width = 6, fig.asp = 0.618, fig.align = "center",
                      out.width = "70%")
```

I then follow with a chunk that loads all libraries required for my analysis.
The following chunk loads the libraries that you installed as a preparation for
the course into your R workspace:

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("cowplot")
library("sf")
library("rnaturalearth")
library("RColorBrewer")
```

**Note**: Libraries only have to be installed once, however, they will have to
be loaded into the R workspace whenever we open a new R session. Think of the
libraries you install as tools that you buy: you buy a hammer the first time you
realise you
want to hang a picture and need a hook in the wall. Once you bought it, you need
to actually bring it to the room where you want to hang the picture. After that,
you have the hammer and can use it whenever you like. The hammer is the
library that you install (buy) once and then load into your R workspace (use)
whenever you have a task that can be accomplished with that hammer.

# Data input
The first step in data analysis with R is to read the data into the R workspace.
We can do this with the `read_csv` function. 

## A primer to R functions
Functions automate common tasks such as reading files into R, creating a 
histogram of your data and saving that histogram in a pdf document.

Functions take a set of arguments, evaluate them and return the result.
There are two possible outcomes that we might want to see when we use a
function:

If we simply want to see the result of the function displayed after execution,
we just type the command and execute it. If we want to store the result in a
variable for future use, we have to assign the outcome of a function into an
object by using the assign operator `<-`. 

To see a description of the function, its arguments and results, use the help
function `?` by typing `?function_name` in the R console. This help function 
proves really useful whenever you want to use a new function or you want
to look up some examples of how to use the function.

# Reading your data
In the following chunk, we pass the filename of the data that we want to load to
`read_csv` function and assign the ouput to a new object called `coord`.

```{r paths}
coord <- read_csv("2004_Science_Smith_data.csv")
```
`read_csv()` prints out a column specification that gives the name and type of
each column.

## Exercises
1. Use the help function`?` to have a look at the documentation of `read_csv`.
2. Have a look at the `coord` object by creating a new chunk,
typing `coord` and executing the code chunk.
3. Do you find the message printed by `read_csv` represented in `coord`?


# Data and object types
The objective of this course is data visualisation and we will not spend a huge
amount of time on learning R's data structures. In the following, we will just
look at a few basic data types and objects that we will encounter in this
course: 

## Data types
The most common data types in R are:
    
* `int`, which stands for integers i.e 1, 2, 3;
* `dbl`, which stands for doubles, or real numbers i.e. 1.2, 1.7, 9.0;
* `chr`, which stands for character vectors, or strings i.e. "a", "b", "word";
* `lgl`, which stands for logical, vectors that contain only TRUE or FALSE;
* `fctr`, which stands for factors, which R uses to represent categorical
variables with fixed possible values.

## Object types
There are many different data types in R. For the purpose of data visualisation
and this workshop, we will only work with two object types:

* `data.frame`: a list of variables with the same number of observations.
Variables are in columns, observations in rows. Rows have unique rownames.
* `tibble`:  tibbles are 'opinionated data frames' with an improved printing
  display, stricter rules for re-formating that aid in avoiding bugs and no
  rownames.

**Note**: Tibbles are newer than data.frames and some old functions will not
work with them and might require actual data.frames; For the majority of our
analyses and visualisations we will work with tibbles.


## Exercises: 
1. Which data types are present in our dataset?
2. How many observations and variables are in our dataset?
3. What are the variables?

# A recipe for generating graphs with ggplot2
In the following section, we will generate our first plots using the `ggplot2`
package. Data visualisation in `ggplot2`, however simple or complex, follows
a general recipe:

1. Setting up a coordinate system with the function `ggplot()`: provide the
  dataset to use in the graph
1. Adding layers with `geom_xxx()` functions:
  * layers are quite literally added to `ggplot()` object, by using the `+` 
    operator;
  * each geom function expects a mapping argument which defines how variables
    are mapped to visualisation. The mapping argument is provided with `aes()`,
    where the x and y arguments describe which variables to map to the x and y
    axes. ggplot2 looks for the mapped variables in the data argument to
    `ggplot()`;
  * There are many geom functions that each add a different type of
    layer to a plot. Their names are very descriptive, for instance:
      * `geom_point` adds a layer of points to the coordinate system,
        effectively creating a scatterplot;
      * `geom_histogram` adds a histogram layer;
      * `geom_boxplot` adds a boxplot layer.

**Note**: The add operator `+` can never be at the start of a line! When adding
multiple layers to a plot, we will always end the layer line with the `+` sign,
never start a new layer with a `+`.

## Our first plot

```{r first plot}
p <- ggplot(data=coord)
p + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=x.coordinate, y=y.coordinate))
```

## Exercises
1. Run ggplot(data = coord). What do you see?
2. What makes this simple plot look very different from the map that we want 
  to achieve?
3. What other information in our data object `coord` could we use?

## Mapping additional aesthetics
To map additional information onto our 2d scatter plot, ggplot2 makes use of
aesthetics. We have already seen aesthetics in the example above, where we
mapped the `x.coordinate` and `y.coordinate` to the x- and y-axis using
`aes(x=x.coordinate, y=y.coordinate)`. Broadly speaking, aesthetics are the
visual properties of the objects in your plot. They include for instance the
size, shape, or color of your points. The different flavors of an aesthetic
are called levels. The levels in the shape aesthetic are for instance round, 
triangular and square. Levels of the color aesthetic could be blue, red and 
yellow. In our graph above, we have not used any of these aesthetics yet.
Let's start by introducing color to the plot. As in the original publication,
we can color the points in our plot by cluster name. We do this by simpling 
specifying the color aestetic in the mapping:

```{r color aes}
p + geom_point(aes(x=x.coordinate, y=y.coordinate, color=cluster))
```

 `ggplot2` automatically assign a unique color level to each unique value of
cluster. This assigment process is called scaling. Depending on data and
aesthetic, `ggplot2` selects a reasonable scale and constructs a legend that
explains the mapping between levels and variable values, in this case color
and cluster. However, we can also provide our own color-scheme.

## Setting scales
Adding scales to `ggplot` objects follows the same scheme as adding layers: we
add the scale to the existing object by the `+` operator. Similar to `geom_xxx`,
we have `scale_xxx_yyy`: xxx specifies the aestetic for which we are providing
the scale, yyy specifies the type of scale we want. For instance:
  
  * `scale_color_continuous` sets a continuous scale for the asthetic color;
  * `scale_shape_discrete` sets a discrete scale for the asthetic shape.

When selecting a scale, we need to consider what
type of data we are displaying and what message we want to convey:
  
  * qualitative data: unordered, distinct categories, as in our example cluster
    names;
  * sequential data: ordered data that progresses from low to high, as in our
    example 'year of isolation';
  * diverging data: data from low to high, with emphasis on mid-range values as
    well for instance correlations that range from -1 to 1, where the mid-range
    around 0 ie no correlation are equally important to be visualised

### Color scales
The [colorbrewer website](http://colorbrewer2.org/) provides a great resource
to pick appropriate color scales.

`ggplot2` has direct access to these color schemes:
```{r brewer, fig.asp = 2.5, echo = FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 3, 0, 0))
RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()
```

```{r color scale}
p +
  geom_point(aes(x=x.coordinate, y=y.coordinate, color=cluster)) +
  scale_color_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Set3")
```

### Shape scales
There are 25 point shapes available in R:

```{r point shapes, echo=FALSE}
positions <- tibble(y=rev(c(rep(1,6),rep(2,5), rep(3,5), rep(4,5), rep(5,5))),
                    x=c(rep(1:5,5),6),
                    text=0:25)
shapes <- ggplot(data=positions)
shapes + geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y),
                    shape=0:25, size=5, fill="orange", color="blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x=x,y=y+0.3,label=text), hjust=0.5, vjust=0.5) +
  theme_void()
```
We can use the shape aesthetic and scale in analogy to how we
specified color.

**Note**: Shapes 0-20 work in conjunction with the color aestetic, 
shapes 21-25 with the color and fill aesthetic. 

## Manual aesthetics
In addition, we could also decide that we would like to display all our points
in the data set as number 17 triangles. To set an aesthetic manually, you move
it outside the mapping argument and specify the level:

```{r manual aesthetic}
p +
  geom_point(aes(x=x.coordinate, y=y.coordinate, color=cluster), shape=17) +
  scale_color_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Set3") 
```

### Exercises
1. Try changing the cluster aesthetic to `size` and `shape`. Does this convey
the same level of information as a color scale?
2. What other variable in our dataset would be well represented by a `shape`
scale? Add a shape aesthetic for the variable you identified.
3. Generally speaking, which type of data lends itself to shape scales, which
to size, which to color?
4. Why does this not work?
```{r}
p +
  geom_point(aes(x=x.coordinate, y=y.coordinate, color=cluster)) +
  scale_color_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Set1")
```
5. Why does this code not color all points in red?
```{r}
p +
  geom_point(aes(x=x.coordinate, y=y.coordinate, color="red")) 
```
6. Advanced: Change the overall shape of points to number 24 triangles, than
color by cluster and fill by type.

## Setting labels and themes
So far, we have been concerned with the data layers of the plot, using
`geom_xxx` to visualise different variables and `scale_xxx_yyy` to customise
them. In the following section, we will have a look at customising the 'canvas'
of the plot, i.e. the background, axis labels etc.

### Coordinate system
Looking at the antigenic map (Figure 1 in the Smith *et al* (2004) paper), we
notice that their axis ratio of 1:1, ensuring that one unit on the y-axis is 
equivalent to one unit on the y-axis. Our plot has a different ratio. Based on
the range of the `x.coordinate` and `y.corrdinate` variable, `ggplot` 
automatically chose the axis limits and more importantly here, their ratios. 
We can easily change this default by adding a `coord_xx` layer, in this case
`coord_fixed`, which will ensure a 1:1 ratio per default.

```{r coordinate system}
p + 
  geom_point(aes(x=x.coordinate, y=y.coordinate, color=cluster)) +
  scale_color_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Set3") +
  coord_fixed()
```

### Labels
Currently, the axis and legend labels in our plot are simply the name of
the variables we mapped to the aesthetics. We can change the axis labels by
providing arguments to the `labs` layer. Specifically, x and y axis
labels can be set by the `xlab` and `ylab` arguments respectively, the title
is specified by the `title` argument. To change the name of a legend, we have
to specify the aesthetic we mapped it to, in this `color`.

```{r labels}
p + 
  geom_point(aes(x=x.coordinate, y=y.coordinate, color=cluster)) +
  scale_color_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Set3") +
  labs(x="Dimension 1 [AU]",
       y="Dimension 2 [AU]",
       title="Antigenic cartography",
       color="Cluster") +
  coord_fixed()
```

### Themes
Finally, we can customise the non-data components of our plot. While the
developers of `ggplot2` had a strong preference for the default grey background,
this is not to everyone's liking. As with everything else you've seen so far,
there are some build-in options for customising. Here, we use the `theme_bw`
to change to a white background.

```{r themes}
p + 
  geom_point(aes(x=x.coordinate, y=y.coordinate, color=cluster)) +
  scale_color_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Set3") +
  labs(x="Dimension 1 [AU]",
       y="Dimension 2 [AU]",
       title="Antigenic cartography",
       color="Cluster") +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_bw()
```

### Exercises
1. What other coordinate system options exist? Hint: type `?coord_` in a new
chunk and press tab to see other options.
2. Rename the legend title for the `shape` aesthetic
3. Test different themes and see how it effects the plot, for instance use
`theme_void`, `theme_dark` and `theme_classic`. Similar to Exercise 1, you can 
type `?theme_` and tab to see other possible build in themes.
4. Why does this not work? 

```{r fail, eval=FALSE}
p + 
  geom_point(aes(x=x.coordinate, y=y.coordinate, color=cluster)) +
  scale_color_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Set3") +
  labs(x="Dimension 1 [AU]",
       y="Dimension 2 [AU]",
       title="Antigenic cartography",
       color="Cluster") +
  coord_fixed()
  + theme_light()
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-themes.png")
```

## Saving your plots
You can save your plots with the `ggsave` function. `ggsave` will save the most
recent plot to your project directory. As argument we only have to provide the
name of the file we want to save it to. `ggsave` will determine the format
of the output file based on the file ending of the filename that you provide.
For instance, the code chunk below will save our most recent plot to a pdf
document named "antigenic_cartography.pdf". 

```{r save plots}
ggsave(filename="antigenic_cartography.pdf")
```

Not only does `ggsave` determine the format of the file from the name, it also
determines the size of the file from the size we chose for displaying the plot
in out analysis. To make it reproducible, it is good practice to specify the
size and units. 

```{r save plots parameters}
ggsave(filename="antigenic_cartography.pdf", width=5, height=8, unit="cm")
```
**Note**: `ggsave` overwrites the previous file of that name without warning!

### Exercises
1. Save the plot as png and jpeg.
2. Change the size of the plot with width and height; what happens to figure
labels and legends?

# Beyond scatter plots
In **section 4**, we have learned the basic recipes for generating a plot with
`ggplot2`. We created a 2D scatter plot, encoding visual information in a 
color and shape scale and made sure we convey the right message by ensuring
appropriate labels and coordinate systems.

In the following section, we will get to know a couple more plot types.

## Bar charts and histograms
Bar charts and histogram visualise the number of observations (count) for a
specified variable, typically with the variable on the x-axis and the count on
the y-axis. For histograms, the x-axis is divided into bins and the number of
observations in each bin is counted. Bar charts are a special case of histogram,
where the bin width is 1, i.e. the counts at each value of the variables are
displayed. 
Bar charts are best described by the calling the help function `?geom_bar`:

    There are two types of bar charts: geom_bar() and geom_col(). geom_bar()
    makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each
    group [..]. If you want the heights of the bars to represent values in the
    data, use geom_col() instead. geom_bar() [...] counts the number of cases at
    each x position. geom_col() [...] leaves the data as is.

In the following, we plot the number of antigen measurements per year and color
them by cluster. As we want the plotting function to figure out the counts, 
we use `geom_bar`. For consistency to our previous plots, we use them same 
theme and color scheme; note, we use `geom_fill` (not `geom_color` as above) to
fill the bars with the specified color.
In addition to the aesthetics, we also specify positions for our bar chart. To
display bars next to each other, we have to specify `position_dodge`,
and setting `preserve="single"`, keeps a constant width for each bar. More on
this in the exercises to this section.

```{r }
p + geom_bar(aes(x=year, fill=cluster),
             position=position_dodge(preserve="single")) +
  scale_fill_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Set3") +
  theme_bw()
```
We can use the same set-up with `geom_histogram`, to visualise the distribution
of antigenic measurements in larger time intervals. The bin width specifies the
range over which to summarise the variable. Again, the help function gives 
good insight with `?geom_histogram`:

    binwidth    [...] You should always override this value, exploring multiple
                widths to find the best to illustrate the stories in your data
                [...].

```{r histogram}
p + geom_histogram(aes(x=year, fill=cluster),
             position=position_dodge(preserve="single"),
             binwidth = 10) +
  scale_fill_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Set3") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Boxplots
Below, we take a different look at the distribution of antigenic measurements
by year, using a boxplot.

"The boxplot compactly displays the distribution of a continuous variable. It
visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers),
and all "outlying" points individually." [`?geom_boxplot`].

We treat `year` as a continuous variable and show its distribution split by the
type of measurement.

To show both the summary of the distribution (boxplot) and the actual data, we 
can add a `geom_jitter` to the plot. It plots the original y-values and adds 
a jitter to the x-values to avoid overplotting.

 
```{r }
p + geom_boxplot(aes(x=type, y=year, color=type)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(x=type, y=year, color=type)) +
  theme_bw()
```
## Geographical maps
So far, we have worked with visualisations of continuous, discrete and
categorical variables. We have worked with the `year` (discrete/continuous),
`cluster`, `type` (both categorical), `x.coordinate` and `y.coordinate` (both
continuous) variables in out data set and used these to display the antigenic
maps and distribution of measurements across time, separated by both cluster
and type. For all these observations, we have an additional variable, the
location of data generation. In the following, we will see how we can use
`ggplot2` to visualise geographic data. 

First, we read a file that contains the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of
all locations that we find in the `location` of our coord object. We then
use the `ne_countries` of the `rnaturalearth` package that we loaded in the
beginning to create an object that countains coordinates of all countries.

As with above, we will then create a `ggplot` object. So far, we provided the
data that we want the visualisation to be applied to in the `ggpot` call.
In this case, we have two different data sets that we want to visualise,
the world map and the locations. In this case, we can also specify the
appropriate dataset to each geom separately.

We use the `geom_sf` to display the world map and a points layer with
`geom_point` to visualise the locations.


```{r world coordinates}
locations <- read_csv("locations.csv")
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")

g <- ggplot()
g + geom_sf(data = world) +
  geom_point(data=locations, aes(x=lng, y=lat), color="blue")
```

## Exercises
1. Test different options for the `position` argument of `geom_bar`. Hint:
use the Details paragraph in `?geom_bar` to find a description about possible
options.
2. What happens when you choose `preserve="total"` in `position_dodge` of
`geom_histogram`? 
3. Customise the color scale and plot labels in the boxplot showing the 
distribution of measurements per type and year. What happens if you choose
`aes(fill)` instead of `aes(color)`?
4. Change `geom_jitter` to `geom_point` to see why zgeom_jitter is a better
visualisation of the data. Go back to using `geom_jitter` and play with the
`width` argument to customise your plot.
4. What would be a good `theme` for the world map? Add it to the plot.
