# Introduction
In the previous tutorial, you have learned how to visualise your data, from
simple scatter plots with default settings to compound figures with elaborate
color schemes and labels. For all of these, we used the data from Smith *et al*
(2004) (made available at the following
[http://www.antigenic-cartography.org/)](link)). I mentioned briefly in the
previous exercises, that I had formated the data for us to work with.
What I experssed here in a half-sentence, usually contains a lot of work, often
more than the actual analysis: cleaning your data, bringing it into the 
right format, checking it for sanity. In the following sections, we will
learn how to use 'dplyr' to reformat data into a 'tidy' format that we can use
for visualisation and analysis.

For a more detailed description and additional examples, refer to chapter 5
in Hadley Wickham book 'R for Data Science' @Wickham2017. I would generally
highly recommend this book, as it introduces concepts we have discussed in this
course and beyond - its online version is available for free
[here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)!

# dplyr: a grammar of data manipulation
The dplyr package is a core member of the tidyverse. dplyr's core functionality
relies on six functions that let us solve the majority of data reformating.
These functions, often described as the `verbs for the language of data
manipulation', are:

* `select()`: to select a subset of variables;
* `arrange()`: to change the order of observations;
* `mutate()`: to add new variables that are functions of existing variables;
* `filter()`:  to subset observations based on their values;
* `summarise()`: to summarise observations to a single row;
* `group_by()`: to change the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to
individual groups.

All verbs work in a similar fashion:
    * their first argument is a `tibble` or `data.frame`;
    * the following arguments describe the action to apply to that 
      `tibble`/`data.frame` by specifying the variable names
    * the result is a new `tibble`/`data.frame`, dependent on the initial input

*Note*: If you want to save the results of a `dplyr` function, you have to use
the assignment operator `<-`, as `dplyr` function never modify their input data.

## Change the order of observations with `arrange()`
Using `arrange()`, we can change the order of rows. As input, `arrange` takes
a `tibble` and a set of variable names - at least one is required. It will 
re-arrange the observations of the `tibble` based on variable selected for
re-ordering. 
If you provided more than one variable to order the tibble by, each additional
variable will be used to break ties in the values of preceding variables.
```{r}

```

As a default, `arrange` orders the variables in ascending order. To re-order in
descending order use `desc()`:
```{r}

```

## Select a subset of variables with `select()`
`select()` let's us pick a subset of variables. In the most simple case,
we specify the `tibble` from which we want to `select()` variables, followed
by the names of the variables that we want to pick:
```{r}

```

To exclude a variable, use `select()` with the variable name preceded by a 
minus `-`.

In addition to that, there a  number of functions that can be used in
conjunction with `select()` that let us select multiple variables with common
elements in their name. These include:
    * starts_with("year"): matches names that begin with “year”.
    * ends_with("coordinate"): matches names that end with “coordinate”.
    * contains("coord"): matches names that contain “coord”.
    * num_range("X", 1:3): matches X1, X2 and X3.
```{r}

```

## Add new variables with `mutate()`
To add new variables to a `tibble`, we use `mutate`. Again, `mutate` first
expects the name of the `tibble` to which we want to add a variable, followed
by the name of the new variable, an equal sign `=` and the data to add. The 
data has to have the same number of observations as our input `tibble` and
can be created by using a transformation of an existing variable:
```{r}

```

*Note*: `mutate()` adds the column at the end of the `tibble`; if you want it
at a different position use `select` to reorder the variables afterwards.

## Select of subset of observations with `filter()`
Using `select` we could create a subset of the input data by selecting
variables. `filter()` allows us to subset our input data by observations.
As a first argument it takes the name of the `tibble`; this
is followed by expressions that filter observations based on their value in the
specified variables. Filtering uses the standard set of comparison operators 
available in R.

### Comparisons
Comparison operators in R:
    * `==`: equal to
    * `!=`: not equal to
    * `>`: greater than
    * `>=`: greater or equal than
    * `<`: less than
    * `<=`: less or equal than

*Note*: When testing for equality, make sure to use `==` and not a simple `=`!

For instance, the following code let's us select all observations of viruses
in circulation after 1988:
```{r}

```

In addition to these comparison operators, we can also use boolean operators tp
filter the input data. The simplest boolean operator is intrinsic to the 
`filter` function: multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with and, i.e.
every expression has to be true for an observation to be kept in the output.
For instance: 
```{r}

```

Any more complicated combinations, like in circulation before 1987 but not 
BILTHOVEN, have to be constructed using the logical operators and `&`, or `|`
and not `!`. The graphic below shows a complete overview of selection
logical subsets of observations for two variables "red" and "blue":

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/operators.jpg", dpi=500)
```

## Group analyses and summarise observations with `group_by` and `summarise()`
 `group_by` and `summarise()` often go hand in hand: using `group_by`, we can
 first group observation based on values in the specified variable and then
 apply a summary statistic on this group. This might sound a bit complicated,
 so let's have a look at an example:

```{r}

```



# Creating a workflow with pipes


```{r eval=FALSE }
circulation_summary <- coord %>%
    group_by(cluster) %>%
    summarise(start=min(year),
              end=max(year),
              location=n_distinct(location)) %>%
    mutate(start=as.numeric(start)) %>%
    mutate(end=as.numeric(end)) %>%
    arrange(start) %>%
    mutate(cluster=factor(cluster)) %>%
    mutate(cluster=fct_inorder(cluster))

p <- ggplot(circulation_summary)
p + geom_segment(aes(x=start, xend=end, y=cluster, yend=cluster)) +
    xlab("Year") +
    ylab("Antigenic cluster") +
    theme_bw()
```
